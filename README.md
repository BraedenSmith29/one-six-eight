# One Six Eight

A small web application designed to help users easily budget their time and become more productive.

### 🔥 Problem Statement

---

Every week has 168 hours. We work for 40 of those, and sleep for (around) another 50-60. Factor in all of the other random things we have to or want to do and all of a sudden you’re out of time. This is something I struggle with, so how do we fix it? Well, planning, but that takes time in itself. My biggest issue is the amount of time I spend not doing things because I’m so worried about what I need to do, or putting things off because “I’ll do it later”. I won’t. Instead, I want a way to set productivity goals and measure my effectiveness in achieving them, *without* spending hours planning. Enter: One Six Eight. This website (app? idk) will allow users to set their productivity goals and quickly preview how to best meet them in minutes, while holding them accountable with weekly reports.
